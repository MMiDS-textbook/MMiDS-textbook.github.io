2/20/15 6:52,riricesq,negative,@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
2/20/15 6:46,MHCone,negative,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
2/20/15 6:45,Peter_D_Ahern,negative,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
2/20/15 6:42,jessergauvin,negative,@USAirways what is the damn delay????
2/20/15 6:42,jessergauvin,negative,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
2/20/15 6:38,mjmena001,negative,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
2/20/15 6:37,riricesq,negative,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
2/20/15 6:35,KarileeD,negative,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
2/20/15 6:34,KarileeD,negative,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
2/20/15 6:34,mjmena001,negative,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
2/20/15 6:32,mjmena001,negative,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
2/20/15 6:28,riricesq,negative,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
2/20/15 6:28,riricesq,negative,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
2/20/15 6:24,mwasserman818,negative,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
2/20/15 6:21,NicholasBSabin,positive,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
2/20/15 6:19,mwasserman818,negative,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
2/20/15 6:18,riricesq,negative,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
2/20/15 6:14,riricesq,negative,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
2/20/15 6:13,tannapistolis,negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
2/20/15 6:13,riricesq,negative,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
2/20/15 6:12,riricesq,negative,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
2/20/15 6:12,riricesq,negative,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
2/20/15 6:11,altadenadad,neutral,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! â›„ï¸èâ˜€ï¸è
2/20/15 6:09,mwasserman818,negative,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
2/20/15 6:08,riricesq,negative,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
2/20/15 6:07,altadenadad,positive,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
2/20/15 6:06,riricesq,negative,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
2/20/15 6:05,riricesq,negative,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
2/20/15 6:03,riricesq,negative,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.

2/20/15 2:52,joyousb,negative,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
2/20/15 2:14,misskiayona,negative,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
2/20/15 1:39,MeganRSmith83,negative,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
2/19/15 23:50,thecoolbelow,negative,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!

2/19/15 21:31,CourtneyEMcCoy,negative,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
2/19/15 21:19,lj_verde,negative,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
2/19/15 21:19,lj_verde,negative,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
2/19/15 21:14,lj_verde,negative,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.

2/19/15 21:03,syfialkoff,negative,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA

2/19/15 20:51,syfialkoff,neutral,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
2/19/15 20:50,syfialkoff,negative,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
2/19/15 20:50,masonkesner,negative,@USAirways Iâ€™ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
2/19/15 20:45,syfialkoff,negative,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
2/19/15 20:41,masonkesner,negative,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guysâ€_see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.

2/19/15 20:23,Allisonjones704,negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
2/19/15 20:23,lj_verde,negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
2/19/15 20:21,Allisonjones704,negative,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.

2/19/15 19:54,tyfletch,negative,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
2/19/15 19:54,Allisonjones704,negative,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
2/19/15 19:52,dave0911,negative,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.

2/19/15 19:10,Allisonjones704,negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
2/19/15 19:08,Allisonjones704,negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
2/19/15 19:07,Allisonjones704,negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
2/19/15 19:05,Allisonjones704,negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
2/19/15 19:04,Allisonjones704,negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
