    "A common task in network analysis is to identify \"central\" vertices in a graph. Centrality is a vague concept. It can be defined in many different ways depending on the context and the type of network. Quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality assign numbers or rankings to nodes within a graph corresponding to their network position. Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, super-spreaders of disease, and brain networks. [...] Centrality indices are answers to the question \"What characterizes an important vertex?\" The answer is given in terms of a real-valued function on the vertices of a graph, where the values produced are expected to provide a ranking which identifies the most important nodes. The word \"importance\" has a wide number of meanings, leading to many different definitions of centrality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an undirected graph, a natural approach is to look at the degree of a vertex as a measure of its importance (also referred to as degree centrality). But it is hardly the only one. One could for instance look at the average distance to all other nodes (its reciprocal is the [closeness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality)) or at the number of shortest paths between pairs of vertices going through the vertex (known as [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality)).
